	The two R scripts in this repository, included in the Word file, implement both the asymptotic and bootstrap versions of the K² test proposed by D’Agostino, Berlanger, and D’Agostino (1990), and provide additional information to support accurate decision-making regarding the null hypothesis of normality.

	Script 1 begins by displaying the original distribution using a density histogram (in yellow), with the kernel density estimate (in blue) and the normal density curve (in red) superimposed. The number of histogram bins is determined by the Freedman and Diaconis (1981) rule; density estimation is performed using the Epanechnikov (1969) kernel with the bandwidth selected according to Sheather and Jones (1991). Under normality, the histogram profile and the two density curves should overlap. As a second graphical resource, a normal quantile–quantile plot is produced using quantiles computed with R’s rule 9 (R Foundation, 2020), in accordance with the specifications of D’Agostino et al. (1990). Under normality, the points should align with the central trend line with a 45-degree slope. To generate these graphs, you must install and load the packages ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al., 2025) and scales (Wickham, Pedersen, Seidel, & Posit, 2025).
	Next, descriptive statistics for the original sample are computed. Three measures of central tendency (arithmetic mean, median, and mode) are calculated, along with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals obtained using the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) percentile method, based on 1,000 resamples drawn with replacement from the original sample (nonparametric bootstrap). Nevertheless, the number of simulations can be increased to 2,000 or 5,000 to improve the stability of the acceleration estimation (Andrews & Buchinsky, 2002). A fixed seed (123) is set to ensure reproducibility of the random samples (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, & Taylor, 2023). Under normality, these three statistics should coincide. The mode is obtained using both the Grenander method and the maximum-frequency value method. Values of k and p are determined according to the asymptotic properties of Grenander’s mode estimator (Grenander, 1950; Hall, 1982). To perform these calculations, you must install and load the packages boot (Canty, Ripley, & Brazzale, 2025) and modeest (Poncet, 2019).
	Measures of variability are then computed, including the minimum, maximum, sample standard deviation, and Pearson’s coefficient of variation. Under normality, the coefficient of variation should be less than 80. In addition, moment-based measures of shape—skewness and kurtosis—are computed, with symmetry assessed using D’Agostino’s (1970) test and mesokurtosis evaluated using the Anscombe and Glynn (1983) test. Under normality, both null hypotheses should be retained. For these calculations, in addition to the boot package (Canty et al., 2025), the moments package (Komsta & Novomestky, 2022) is required.
	Subsequently, the K² statistic is computed, together with its asymptotic p-value (pₐₛᵧₘₚ) and its asymptotic statistical power (ϕₐₛᵧₘₚ). The p-value is obtained from the chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom, whereas power is computed using the noncentral chi-square distribution, also with two degrees of freedom and a noncentrality parameter equal to K², evaluated at the 0.95 quantile of the central chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom.
	On the one hand, the bootstrap distribution under the null hypothesis of normality is obtained through 1,000 simulations drawn from the standard normal distribution, using a fixed seed of 1234. From this distribution, the bootstrap critical value is calculated as the 0.95 quantile. The bootstrap p-value (pᵦₒₒₜ) is computed as the area under the curve in the right tail beyond the observed value of K² in this distribution.
	On the other hand, the bootstrap distribution of K² is obtained by drawing 1,000 samples with replacement from the original sample (nonparametric bootstrap), using a fixed seed of 123. From this distribution, the area under the curve in the right tail beyond the bootstrap critical value (defined under the null hypothesis of normality) is computed, yielding the bootstrap statistical power at a significance level of α = 0.05 (ϕ₍ᵦₒₒₜ₎), under the alternative hypothesis that the original sample deviates from normality.
	If the null hypothesis of normality is not rejected (pᵦₒₒₜ ≥ 0.05), power should be less than or equal to 0.5 (ϕᵦₒₒₜ ≤ 0.5), and preferably less than or equal to 0.2 (ϕᵦₒₒₜ ≤ 0.2). Conversely, if the null hypothesis is rejected (pᵦₒₒₜ < 0.05), power should be greater than 0.5 (ϕᵦₒₒₜ > 0.5), and preferably greater than 0.8 (ϕᵦₒₒₜ > 0.8). In any other case, the results are considered ambiguous (Zhang & Yuan, 2018).
	Additionally, a plot is presented showing the density histogram and density curve of the bootstrap normative sampling distribution of the K² statistic under the null hypothesis of normality (yellow), together with the density curve of the bootstrap empirical sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., the sample itself; green) and the χ² distribution with two degrees of freedom, representing the asymptotic sampling distribution of K² (blue). The figure also displays the observed K² value (green) and the corresponding critical values—bootstrap (yellow) and asymptotic (blue)—as vertical lines.
	The goodness of fit of the empirical bootstrap distribution (drawn from the original sample) and the theoretical bootstrap distribution (drawn from the standard normal distribution) to a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom was assessed using the Anderson–Darling test (Anderson & Darling, 1952). The degrees of freedom were either specified as 2 or estimated by maximum likelihood, using 2 as the initial value. To perform these tests, the goftest (Faraway, Marsaglia, Marsaglia & Baddeley, 2021) and fitdistrplus (Delignette-Muller, Dutang, Pouillot, Denis & Siberchicot, 2025) packages must be installed and loaded. The latter package also requires the MASS (Ripley et al., 2025) and survival (Therneau, Lumley, Atkinson, & Crowson, 2024) packages.
	Finally, as supplementary tests for assessing normality, the W test of Shapiro and Wilk (1965), with Royston’s (1992) transformation and standardization applicable to samples ranging from 3 to 2000 observations, and the W′ test of Shapiro and Francia (1972), with Royston’s (1993) transformation and standardization applicable to samples ranging from 5 to 5000 observations, were reported. The W or W′ statistics, the corresponding Z or Z′ transformations, the p-values, and the bootstrap power were computed. To estimate power, 10,000 samples were simulated from the original sample, treating it as the alternative hypothesis. The proportion of samples in which the null hypothesis of normality was rejected at a significance level of α = 0.05 corresponds to the estimated power. For these tests, the nortest package (Gross & Ligges, 2015) must be installed and loaded.

	Script 2 is included to evaluate the nonlinear association between √b₁ and b₂ using eta squared derived from a LOESS regression (R²₍b₂|√b₁₎). The confidence interval for R² was estimated via the percentile method of a nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 replications drawn from the original sample. Script 2 is shown in Appendix 2. The ggplot2 package (Wickham, Chang, et al., 2025) is all that is required for its execution.

	Script 1 can be executed either locally or online via the Snippets platform (https://rdrr.io/snippets/). When run on this platform, Script 1 required 16.870 s of user time, 0.270 s of system time, and 17.563 s of elapsed time. To use it, simply replace the sample data—highlighted in dark blue—with your own. Copy the script and paste it into the top white window, then click the Run button. The output will appear in the lower window with a sand-colored background.
	When executed online, figures cannot be saved as files; however, they can be copied as images (e.g., using Ctrl + Windows + S). Local execution on a personal computer requires R ≥ 3.5.0, although the use of the most recent version is recommended. RStudio (https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) provides a more user-friendly environment than the R console and is therefore recommended. Proceed as you would online: replace the data, copy and paste, then click the Execute button. In the R console, the code runs directly once you paste it.
	Script 2, which estimates the association between √b₁ and b₂, cannot be executed online under the specified simulation framework because its execution time exceeds the one-minute (60 s) limit imposed by the platform. When executed locally using R version 4.5.1 on a desktop computer equipped with an Intel® Celeron® J4025 CPU @ 2.00 GHz, 12.0 GB of RAM (11.8 GB usable), and a 64-bit operating system (x64-based processor), the execution time of Script 2 was 284.65 s of user time, 4.94 s of system time, and 378.75 s of elapsed time. On the same computer, the execution time of Script 1 was 18.02 s of user time, 1.19 s of system time, and 22.76 s of elapsed time.
